# Case Studies

We have evaluated Confluo for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the design and implementation for three such applications: 

* [A network monitoring and diagnosis tool](network_monitoring.md)
* [A time-series database](timeseries_db.md)
* [A pub-sub system](pub_sub.md)

We also evaluate each of these applications against state-of-the art approaches in their respective domains.
