# MIND: In-Network Memory Management for Disaggregated Data Centers

## Overview
MIND is an in-network memory management system for compute-memory disaggregation.

## What is resource disaggregation and its benefits?
Resource disaggregation physically seprates compute and memory into network-attached resource blades, which can provide

* higher resource utilization,
* better support for hardware heterogeneity,
* resource elasticity, and 
* failure handling,

compared to traditional data center architectures.
