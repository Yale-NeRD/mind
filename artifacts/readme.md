## Overall steps
- Create cluster (please use our profile in CloudLab)
- Configure a programmable switch
- Configure servers and VMs running on the servers (can be easily done by running a script but it takes time to copy files)
- Run scripts to execute benchmarks (in the management server; red arrow in the figure)
