/// A #xed_disassembly_callback_fn_t takes an address, a pointer to a
/// symbol buffer of buffer_length bytes, and a pointer to an offset. The
/// function fills in the symbol_buffer and sets the offset to the desired
/// offset for that symbol.  If the function succeeds, it returns 1. 
//  The call back should return 0 if the buffer is not long enough to
//  include the null termination.If no symbolic information is
//  located, the function returns zero.
///  @param address The input address for which we want symbolic name and offset
///  @param symbol_buffer A buffer to hold the symbol name. The callback function should fill this in and terminate
///                       with a null byte.
///  @param buffer_length The maximum length of the symbol_buffer including then null
///  @param offset A pointer to a xed_uint64_t to hold the offset from the provided symbol.
///  @param context This void* pointer passed to the disassembler's new interface so that the caller can identify 
///                     the proper context against which to resolve the symbols.
