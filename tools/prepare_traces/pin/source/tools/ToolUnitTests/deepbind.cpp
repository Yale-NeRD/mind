 * This test checks the usage of the -selfcontained_tool knob. This knob loads the
 * tool with the RTLD_DEEPBIND flag, making it a self-contained library. The test
 * verifies that the usage does not impact Pin or the application. We override two
 * libc functions, "sched_yield" and "sleep", which are used by the application and
 * Pin. Both functions will cause the process to exit with a non-zero return value.
 * "sched_yield" is implemented in this file, while "sleep" is implemented in
 * deepbind_syscalls.o which is linked to the tool.
