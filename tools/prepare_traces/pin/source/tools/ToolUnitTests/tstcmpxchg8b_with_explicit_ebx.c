compare 64 bit value od edx:eax with the destination memory operand.
  if ==
     store ecx:ebx in the destination memory operand and zf=1
  if !=
     store load the destination memory operand into edx:eax and zf=0

This test checks that the correct memory location is referenced when ebx is
explicitly used in the memory operand of the cmpxchg8b instruction.
