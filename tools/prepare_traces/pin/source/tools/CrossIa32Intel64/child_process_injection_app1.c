 * This application is used by the tests: "child_process_injection1.test" and "child_process_injection1_mac.test"
 * The argument passed should be an app with setuid privileges. In Linux chfn is used when available, whilst in macOS* a
 * utility is built and its privileges are altered.
 * For this test we run pin with -follow-execv, so pin will try to inject and should be unsuccessful due to privilege, but we
 * still expect the child to run natively.
