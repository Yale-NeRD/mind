/*
 * Default tool to be used for Debugger tests in macOS for tests which don't have their own tool.
 * This tool only initialize basic stuff without any instrumentation and continue to run the program.
 * This is needed since currently the only way to place breakpoint in macOS is to to process the application image and today
 * we do that only when there is a tool (conceptually if there is no tool then we don't have any instrumentation,
 * no analysis routines and so on, although in probe mode we do that, need to check it).
 * The data of the main image is being passed to the lldb front end which use
 * this information in order to be able to place breakpoints and so on.
