/* Description:
 * This test checks that Pin does not crash when it runs with an illegal envp array.
 * The expected format of the envp array is an array of strings, each of the form
 * "KEY=VALUE", and the array should be terminated with a NULL pointer.
 * We expect Pin to ignore any illegal entries (i.e. not of the above mentioned form)
 * and to let the application handle these errors by itself. This test checks two
 * forms of illegal entries: one that holds only a KEY and an entry which holds an
 * empty string. We expect Pin to ignore the illegal entries and the test application
 * to run properly despite the illegal environment.
 */

/* Usage:
 * We assume that a copying test application is passed along with "from" and "to"
 * parameters. We will then use execve to run the test application with an illegal
 * environment to see if Pin crashes or ignores the environment.
